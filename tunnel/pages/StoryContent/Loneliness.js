                    During my usual commute to the University of Washington on the light rail, I couldn't help but stare out at the surroundings wishing my life was more vibrant. I realized that I wanted some company, but felt frustrated that I didn't have any.
                    <br /><br />
                    In the past, I made great efforts to initiate conversations with others, but despite my commitment, I must have come across as insincere, which turned people away. So, I decided to accept it and enjoy my quiet time alone.

                    I stepped off the light rail feeling a bit drained and made my way to my first class with a bit of reluctance. As I sat in my usual spot at the back of the lecture room, I couldn't help but notice my classmates engaging in lively conversations around me.
                    <br /><br />
                    I found myself wishing that someone would talk to me and make me feel more alive. Although I daydreamed about all the social interactions I wanted to have, it left me feeling disconnected.

                    As I sat in class, I found myself struggling to pay attention. I wondered if my daily commute had robbed me of opportunities to connect with others. I noticed my classmates laughing and having a good time as they chatted about all the latest events on and off campus, their club activities, and plans to hang out with friends. It made me realize how much I longed to have that same experience in my own life. It was a feeling that I couldn't shake off.

                    It's been a year since I had those thoughts, and now I'm in my Sophomore year and things are looking up. I'm excited to move into my on-campus dorm and finally have roommates to keep me company. It's a change I've been looking forward to for a while now.
                    <br /><br />
                    I thought things were finally looking up when I moved in, but it turned out to be a bit more complicated than I had hoped.

                    My roommates already knew each other and it quickly became clear that I was the outsider. Night after night, they would go out with their friends, leaving me feeling left out. I couldn't help but feel frustrated.
                    <br /><br />
                    My new home felt just like my old lecture room, and I couldn't help but blame my roommates. I even considered complaining to the resident advisor in hopes that she could help me get out of this situation.
                    <br /><br />
                    In the end, I never complained. I was hopeful that not wasting time on the commute would drastically change my life, but it didn't. Just like last year, I found myself sitting in the back of all my lectures, feeling invisible. None of my classes had group work, which meant that I had very few opportunities to interact with my classmates.

                    Four weeks have flown by and here I am at the end of another uneventful, wet, and cloudy Seattle day. As I'm getting ready to leave the Savery Hall classroom, I notice an umbrella on the floor. I assume it must have belonged to a student who was sitting in front of me.
                    <br /><br />
                    I contemplate on what to do. A part of me feels terrible knowing that it might rain later and my classmate who left the umbrella behind might get caught in the rain. I decide to grab the umbrella and catch my classmate halfway down the stairs. I ask her if she had forgotten an umbrella by any chance.

                    <br /><br />
                    I don't want to admit that I like observing people from a distance, as I think it will come across as weird. So, I tell her that I sit in the back for sleeping purposes, and she nods understandingly. We continue our conversation outside the building.

My classmate tells me about herself and how her first quarter is going, and she wants to hear my thoughts about course content and stress.

                    I don't feel like I'm in a great position to provide any advice, but I feel indebted to my classmate who reached out to me first. I try to think of something helpful to say, hoping to come across as intelligent.

                    The idea of talking to my roommates right now doesn't seem like the best idea. After all, the most interaction I've had with them so far has been simple greetings followed by them having conversations with each other while I watch from the sidelines.

                    <br /><br />

                    I enter the room, but as I try to start a conversation, the only thing that comes out is a greeting. My roommates acknowledge me briefly before going back to their conversation.
